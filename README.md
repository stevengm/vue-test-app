## Project Overview

- **Vue.js and Vite:** Vue.js is the primary JavaScript framework used for building the UI components, and Vite is the build tool used to enhance the development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Used for styling the application to create a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **HTML:** Structures the page and hosts the user interface.
- **Javascript (Vue.js):** Consumes the API and dynamically displays and sorts the data.
